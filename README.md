# CU-Sewer-Metagenomics
 Analysis of CU Boulder sewer system metagenome (from sampling effort for SARS-CoV2 detection) focused on temporal patterns. Sampling was headed by Cresten Mansfeldt.
 Analysis completed as final project for EBIO 5460 "Applications of Shotgun Metagenomics in Microbial Ecology" taught by Noah Fierer.

 12 longitudinal 24 hr composite samples were collected from 17 locations throughout the month of September, 2020. These were sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq, resulting in roughly 2 billion paired end reads.
 Taxonomy was assigned using PhyloFlash and the SILVA reference genome. This analysis starts with the output taxonomy table.
